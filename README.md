## Problem

Health Consultation Disparities in Rural Nigerian Areas

## Problem Statement

Inadequate access to quality health consultations is a significant contributor to Nigeria's poor healthcare services, particularly in rural communities.

Delayed diagnosis, inadequate treatment, and increased morbidity and mortality rates are consequences of limited access to quality health consultations. 

Misinformation and myths also spread in the absence of reliable health information. 

Additionally, preventive care suffers, exacerbating health disparities and economic burdens. 

Addressing this issue is crucial to improving Nigeria's healthcare sector.

Quality health consultations are essential for timely, accurate, and personalized healthcare delivery.

## Facts Research
We researched on data and facts to gather information on the problem and it's possible solution.

## Team's Solution Ideas

Through divergent thinking, we brainstormed indiviually and collectively. We came up a number of bad and good ideas. They includes;

- Set up small solar panel booths in rural areas to facilitate remote calls to doctors.
- Hospital  in the market
- Robotic Smart Consultant (Smart Doctor Sam).
- AI diagnostic app
- Train traditional healers to prescribe modern medications
- AI  diagnosis and prognosis app
- Solar-powered  Telehealth clinics/ stations
- Online platform for specialist consultations where rural healthcare professionals connect with urban-based specialist for consultations and advice
- Short Message Service (SMS)-based health information platform/ system


## Team's Final Solution Idea

Through convergent thinking, we finalized on a possible solution. The solution idea is;
## Solar-powered Telehealth Stations:
 Solar-powered telehealth stations will be built across different areas in
communities with the following features:

- [x] 24/7 power supply with solar panels
- [x] 24/7 Internet Connectivity with 5G router
- [x] Electronic device: A Tablet or Flat screen for the telehealth website
- [x] Free & Easy-to-use vital Sign equipment
- [x] Biometric Drug Dispenser for rountine, analgesic, antihypertensives drugs etc.

Just like making a call in a phone booth even when you do not have a phone, this Solution will enable user walk in to the nearest telehealth station and speak with highly
qualified health Practitioners.
