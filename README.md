## 🩹 The Problem

### Health Consultation Disparities in Rural Nigerian Areas

Limited access to quality healthcare consultations remains a pressing challenge in many rural Nigerian regions. This shortage contributes to delayed diagnoses, inadequate treatments, and higher morbidity and mortality rates. In the absence of reliable medical information, misinformation and myths flourish, further endangering public health.

Additionally, preventive care efforts are weakened, aggravating both health and economic inequalities. Ensuring access to quality consultations is essential for timely, accurate, and personalized healthcare delivery across Nigeria.

## 📊 Research and Insights

Extensive data gathering and research were conducted to understand the underlying causes of consultation disparities and explore potential solutions. The process involved analyzing health infrastructure gaps, local communication challenges, and technology adoption barriers.

## 💡 Ideation Process

A combination of **divergent and convergent thinking** techniques was applied to generate and refine ideas. Brainstorming sessions led to a variety of creative solutions, including:

* Establishing solar-powered booths for remote consultations with doctors.
* Creating “Hospital in the Market” setups.
* Developing *Robotic Smart Consultant (Smart Doctor Sam)* prototypes.
* Designing AI-powered diagnostic and prognosis applications.
* Training traditional healers to safely integrate modern medical practices.
* Launching SMS-based health information platforms.
* Creating online telehealth systems connecting rural and urban specialists.

Through convergent thinking, the team identified **Solar-Powered Telehealth Stations** as the most viable and sustainable solution.

These stations would be strategically located within rural communities and equipped with the following features:

* Continuous power supply via **solar panels**.
* **5G Internet connectivity** for seamless video consultations.
* **Tablets or smart displays** for accessing telehealth websites.
* **Free and easy-to-use vital sign equipment**.
* **Biometric drug dispensers** for routine medications (e.g., analgesics, antihypertensives).

Just as phone booths provide connectivity even without personal devices, these stations would enable individuals to connect directly with certified healthcare practitioners at no cost.
